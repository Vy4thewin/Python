This week we will enact the same principles but in Python' Dash app. The Dash library can create apps where users can interact with the program to display the chosen app. \n",

    "From my experience in module two, My device cannot handle large data with plotly. Following the module's sample notebook, it will be wise to create a query for the needed data below. I created two versions of the data selected with SoQL. This way, the query can bypass the api limitations on data and the data grouping is eaiser on loading.\n",

    "The first query will contain the borough of the tree, it's specices, and the count of the health status. The second query will all of the first query's variables and the steward varible. The two query have all the necessary information asked for in assignment's questions and mindful of the size of the data. Next, we will move onto the appropirate visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first graph, we can show the proportion of trees by its health status with a bar graph. It's the most fitting visualization as we can group by borough and filter the plot by health. The second graph,it was the most confusing one to develop. First, I though of a correlation map but my variables made the plot diffcult to view/ understand. For simipilicty, we can also go with a bar graph."
